# About

These are tutorials on how to get started using the CLTK in your research. Where as [the CLTK official docs](https://docs.cltk.org) just explain individual functions, these are intended to be more illustrative of how you can use those functions together to answer real scholarly questions.

Pull requests are welcome.
